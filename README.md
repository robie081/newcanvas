First personal project called "Timeless Wisdom". 
I tried to keep the design minimalist in a grayish tone and mobile first and responsive. 
I used Google Material Icons for the hamburger and a Full screen Overlay Navigation for mobile menu.  
I used Pagination for iterating through pages and Flexbox for the Main Content Layout. 
Use of reset.css and HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
